# IP Messaging Quickstart for Python

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your
own messaging apps with Twilio IP Messaging. Before we begin, we need to collect
all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config Value  | Description |
| :-------------  |:------------- |
Service Instance SID | Like a database for your IP Messaging data - [generate one in the console here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/ip-messaging/services)
Account SID | Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the console here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/ip-messaging/getting-started).
API Key | Used to authenticate - [generate one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/ip-messaging/dev-tools/api-keys).
API Secret | Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll get one here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/ip-messaging/dev-tools/api-keys).

## A Note on API Keys

When you generate an API key pair at the URLs above, your API Secret will only
be shown once - make sure to save this in a secure location, 
or possibly your `~/.bash_profile`.

## Setting Up The Python Application

This application uses the lightweight [Flask Framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/). 
Begin by creating a configuration file for your application:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with the four configuration parameters we gathered from above. Export
the configuration in this file as system environment variables like so on Unix
based systems:

```bash
source .env
```

Next, we need to install our depenedencies:

```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now we should be all set! Run the application using the `python` command.

```bash
python app.py
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
